# ShootHoop on Linux

Built on Ubuntu Gnome 16.10 and Unity Unity 5.5.0xb5Linux 

This is my work going through the Udemy.com couse "Make Mobile VR Games in Unity with C#  for Google Cardboard | Udemy."
Here's a link to the course - https://www.udemy.com/vrcourse/

The course is designed to be done on a Mac or Windows PC using a slightly outdated version of Unity3d.  I've been the newest available Linux version of unity: Unity 5.5.0xb5Linux - found here https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/.  I have found no compatibility issues in this course on the Linux version.  The only issues I encountered were deprecated functions being used which were easy to fix.

Note that there are 2 slightly newer versions of Unity for Linux ready but the .deb files are currently not working due to a known issue that Unity is working out.  Iâ€™ll update everything when newer versions come out.

####To Do
1. Make a google cardboard/daydream version of the game
2. Improve menus
3. reduce noise on basketball sound effects (sounds pretty bad right now)
